## Extinguished

Welcome to Extinguished! This game was created by Eli Marable to submit to [Ludum Dare #50](https://ldjam.com/).

### Project setup

This game was created using plain HTML and ES5, however it does use XMLHttpRequests so it will need to be run
in a webserver. Simply navigate to the repository directory and run:

```
npx http-server
```

And then open <http://localhost:8080> in your web browser.

You may need to [install NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
